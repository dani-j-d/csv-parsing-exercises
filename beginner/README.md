Build a node.js script that parses a csv (comma separated values)

Csv parse npm dependency already added to project

https://csv.js.org/parse
https://csv.js.org/parse/api/sync

If you have extra time (bonus points) consider doing stats (count, average, percentage of types, etc) from your chosen csv file

The UI is not needed for the beginner workshop

To setup and run (requires node to be installed)

`npm install` or `yarn` if installed
`node parse.js`

npm package for csv parsing (already included in package.json)
https://csv.js.org/parse/

CSV File provided or find/create your own
./marvel_characters_info.csv
